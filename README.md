# libkrb5

This repository contains both work-in-progress safe, idiomatic rust bindings for
`libkrb5`, the client library of [MIT Kerberos 5][krb5], and the underlying
"unsafe" bindings generated by `bindgen` in `libkrb5-sys`.

## Thread-safety

According to the libkrb5 documentation, MIT Kerberos 5 is [thread-safe] as of
version 1.4, with the exception of context initialization and de-initialization
functions, which are expected to not run concurrently on different threads.
For this reason, calls to the `krb5_init_context` and `krb5_init_secure_context`
functions as well as `krb5_free_contex` are synchronized by a global Mutex.

**NOTE**: Running this crate's test suite with LLVM's sanitizers shows errors
in some cases. AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer show no issues, but
MemorySanitizer makes the build fail during the build of `log` (so that's
unrelated to this crate), and ThreadSanitizer fails - apparently due to false
positives in the `lazy_static` code (according to a [closed issue][tsan]).

To my best knowledge, this library follows the documentation regarding
thread-safe usage of libkrb5 (context initialization and teardown protected
by a global Mutex), and all other functions in libkrb5 should be thread-safe.

## Contributions welcome

If you see a bug or want to expand API coverage, it should be fairly easy to
look at the existing wrapper functions and adapt that code for other `libkrb5`
APIs.
